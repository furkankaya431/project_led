Esp32 with Nextion
first, the screen requested from the nextion editor was designed.
then uploaded to the nextion HMI panel via USB-TTL.
NOTE: Please pay attention to the inch and model specifications of the panel you are using.
Download libraries related to esp32 in arduino ino. 
NOTE: If you add the ITELAB.rar file as a library from the arduino editor. you will not have problems.
When you download the rar. files, you can install them one by one on your microcontroller with the extraction process. In UART 2, ie esp32, connect pin 16 (receiver) and pin 17 (transmitter) with computer and VCC, RX, TX, GND pins with nextion pins.
have fun in advance :)
